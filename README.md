# Energy Efficiency Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses the Energy Efficiency dataset from UC Irvine to predict heating and cooling loads (Y1 and Y2) of buildings based on 8 input variables. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, we applied various preprocessing techniques and machine learning models, including Gradient Boosting Regressor and Kernel Ridge.

Key Findings:
- Preprocessing: Standard scaling showed the best performance.
- Models: Gradient Boosting Regressor with hyperparameter tuning outperformed others, achieving high predictive accuracy.
- Performance: The model showed strong results with minimal overfitting, especially for Y1.
